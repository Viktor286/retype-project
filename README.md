## :computer: Improve typing and code patterns through practice

Code writing requires a different typing skill than regular text. To become comfortable and fast at coding, it's important to practice special characters like brackets, semicolons, math operators, and others. Typos and mistakes can significantly interrupt your workflow, decreasing both development speed and experience.

An effective way to train code patterns is by retyping real-world code examples. With this typing trainer, you can learn to write code faster by mastering your typing technique. Strong code-typing skills let you focus on solving problems instead of wrestling with syntax.

## :zap: Practice with open source code
Use "Retype Project" to practice with any open source code file from GitHub.
Python, Javascript, PHP, C, C++, Java — all top programming languages.
Add "rt" text after the "github" domain name before ".com" to get github file as a code typing training session.

Or use this bookmarklet to easily switch between GitHub and Retype:
```
javascript:(() => {let l = window.location; let h = l.host; let c = l.href; let rt = 'retypeproject.com'; let g = 'github.com';
l.href = h == rt ? c.replace(rt, g) : h == g ? c.replace(g, rt) : 'https://' + rt})();
```

## :video_game: Learn new programming languages, syntax and APIs quickly
Different languages have different syntax, interfaces, and frameworks. Sometimes you need to quickly switch between something like Python's NumPy and JavaScript's React.

Just a couple of exercises per day/week will help you to quickly adapt to a new programming language, interface, or framework pattern.

Example: I am rarely writing SQL queries by hand but I don't want to forget how to write complex JOINs constructions, so as part of my typing training routine from time to time I write several SQL commands just to refresh my memory.

## Discover GitHub
GitHub is a community to discover new ideas, people, approaches, and trends.
Check out [trending repos and developers](https://github.com/trending?since=weekly) to find interesting projects.

## Create your own typing playlist
Create a training program by organizing files in your GitHub repository as a custom coding exercise set.
If you're logged in, you can access private files from your repositories.

## New to touch typing?
