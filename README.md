### Improve programming skills by retyping code

Code writing requires special kind of typing skill, a bit different from regular text typing.
In order to get comfortable and fast in coding it's important to practice the special characters flow of symbols like brackets, semicolons, math operators and others.
Typos and mistakes can significantly interrupt working process which decreases both dev speed and dev experience.

The great way to achieve a good results in training code patterns is retyping real-life code examples. With typing trainer like that you can learn to write code faster mastering your keyboarding technique.
Great code-typing skills offers more freedom in creating your projects without paying attention cost to complex patterns of code syntax.

### Retype Project is for opensource
Use "Retype Project" to exercise any open source code file from the largest repository in the world!
Python, Javascript, PHP, C, C++, Java — all top programming languages.
Add "rt" text after the "github" domain name before ".com" to get github file as code typing training session.

Or use bookmarklet to easy switch between github and retype:
```
javascript:(() => {let l = window.location; let h = l.host; let c = l.href; let rt = 'retypeproject.com'; let g = 'github.com';
l.href = h == rt ? c.replace(rt, g) : h == g ? c.replace(g, rt) : 'https://' + rt})();
```

### Get in touch with new programming languages, syntax and APIs quickly
The world has plenty of different code syntax, interfaces, special frameworks and sometimes you need to quickly switch gears between something like python's NumPy and javascript's React.

Just a couple of exercise per day/week will help you to quickly adapt to a new programing language, interface or framework pattern.

Example: i am rarely write SQL queries by hand but i don't want to forget how to write complex JOINs constructions, so as part of my typing training routine from time to time i write several SQL commands just to refresh my memory.

### Why this works?
Muscle memory, patterns pickup, peripheral vision training, concentration skill, semantic memory improving, discipline routine — among the many reasons.

### Take advantage of typing routine
Use retyping exercise to switch your focus and attention during the day. Fine motor skills exercises can help to take your mind off.  Regular repetition within day-or-two interval helps to increase the quality of sensory and procedural memory.

### Discover Github
Github is awesome community to discover new ideas, people, approaches, trends.
Don't forget to checkout [trending repos and developers](https://github.com/trending?since=weekly) out there.

### Create your own typing playlist
Make your own training program as collection of files in your github repository and have your own custom coding exercise set.
If you're logged in then you can have access to unlicensed files from your repository.

### Typing skill required!
If you are new in typing and if you want to learn how to increase your level of touch typing, there is several great resources to start with: [one](https://www.typing.com/), [two](https://www.ratatype.com/learn/), [three](https://www.keybr.com/).
